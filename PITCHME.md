## Why not relational databases?
### - Not designed for clustered solutions
### - Not a good fit for current hardware and architectures

---

# Solutions
- Clustering
- Flexible Schema
- Relax consistency
- Denormalization of data

---

# Cassandra
 A fully distributed, masterless database, offering superior scalability,
 and fault tolerance to traditional single-master databases

---

# Horizontal scalability

---

# High availability

---
# Write Optimization

---

# Efficient result ordering

---

# Immediate Consistency

---

# Creating a keyspace
